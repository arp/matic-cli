**-----**
**To setup multi-node local network (via docker)**
**-----**

It will ask you several questions (default values are provided):

```
Please enter Bor chain id - Input the bor chain id you want
Please enter Heimdall chain id - Input the heimdall chain id you want
Please enter Bor docker tag - Input the bor tag you want to deploy
Please enter Heimdall docker tag - Input the heimdall tag you want to deploy
Please enter Contracts branch - Input the contracts branch
Please enter number of validator nodes - Input the number of validator nodes you want to run
Please enter number of non-validator nodes - Input the number of sentry nodes you want to run
Please enter ETH url - Input the eth url to use
Please select devnet type - docker
```

Notes:
1. We have provided the default values where ever so to ensure smooth functioning of the process

**After the setup is done, follow these steps for local docker deployment:**

Start ganache
```bash
bash docker-ganache-start.sh
```

Start all heimdall instances (it will run all services - rabbitmq, heimdall, bridge, server)
```bash
bash docker-heimdall-start-all.sh
```

Setup bor
```bash
bash docker-bor-setup.sh
```

Start bor
```bash
bash docker-bor-start-all.sh
```

Logs

Logs will be at `logs/` folder

**To setup multi-node remote network**
**-----**

It will ask you several questions:

```
Please enter Bor chain id - Input the bor chain id you want
Please enter Heimdall chain id - Input the heimdall chain id you want
Please enter Bor docker tag - Input the bor tag you want to deploy
Please enter Heimdall docker tag - Input the heimdall tag you want to deploy
Please enter Contracts branch - Input the contracts branch
Please enter number of validator nodes - Input the number of validator nodes you want to run
Please enter number of non-validator nodes - Input the number of sentry nodes you want to run
Please enter ETH url - Input the eth url to use
Please select devnet type - remote
Please enter comma separated hosts/IPs - Enter the IPs
```

Notes:
1. The host machine and remote machine has to be an linux machine with ubuntu as user
2. The first machine will be used for ganache as well so enter the ETH url as - http://<1st machine IP>:9545
3. Make sure that the host machines has access to remote machines for transferring the data
4. We have provided the default values where ever so to ensure smooth functioning of the process

**After the setup is done, follow these steps for local docker deployment:**

1. Log into first machine and run ganache:
```bash
cd ~/
bash ganache-start-remote.sh
```

2. Log into the remote machines and on each machine run the following steps in different terminals:
```bash
cd ~/node
bash heimdalld-setup.sh
heimdalld start
```

```bash
heimdalld rest-server
```

```bash
bridge start --all
```

```bash
cd ~/node
bash bor-setup.sh
bash bor-start.sh
```

**-----**
**Clean Setup**
**-----**

Remove the devnet folder and you can start the process once again
